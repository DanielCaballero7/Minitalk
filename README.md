**Minitalk: A Communication Protocol Implementation**

## Overview

"Minitalk" is a captivating project that demonstrates my skills in interprocess communication (IPC) and signal handling in C. This project involves implementing a communication protocol between a client and a server, showcasing my proficiency in low-level networking concepts.

## Description

"Minitalk" presents a communication protocol where a client sends messages to a server using signals. The client encodes the message into a bitstream and sends it to the server, which decodes and displays the message.

The project involves designing both the client and the server applications. The client reads input from the user and converts it into a binary representation. It then sends the binary data bit by bit to the server, which decodes and reconstructs the original message.

The communication between the client and server is achieved using signal handling techniques in C, making "Minitalk" a unique and challenging project in interprocess communication.

## Key Features

- **Signal-Based Communication**: "Minitalk" utilizes signals to enable communication between the client and server, showcasing my expertise in signal handling in C.

- **Binary Data Transmission**: The project demonstrates my ability to convert and transmit binary data efficiently between processes.

- **Error Handling**: "Minitalk" includes robust error handling to manage potential issues and ensure reliable communication.

- **Low-Level Networking Concepts**: The project involves low-level networking concepts, highlighting my knowledge of interprocess communication techniques.

## Outcome

Developing "Minitalk" has deepened my understanding of signal handling and IPC in C. The project showcases my ability to implement unique communication protocols and manage data transmission effectively.

## Technologies Used

- C programming language

## Usage

To test and use "Minitalk," follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile both the client and server C files.
3. Run the server application in one terminal.
4. Run the client application in another terminal, providing the server's PID and the message to send.

## Note

"Minitalk" is a personal project created for educational and demonstrative purposes. It is not intended for commercial use but serves as a testament to my skills in interprocess communication and signal handling.
